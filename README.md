# Data Crunching for C++

Data processing and analysis (also known as data crunching) are core aspects of software engineering.
Programming languages like Python (Pandas) provide feature-rich libraries that allow to express data crunching in a compact, yet powerful way.
The goal of this project is to provide a type-aware and type-safe data crunching library for C++20 (and ongoing) offering an intuitive and easy-to-use syntax.
